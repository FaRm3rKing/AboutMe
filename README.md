# About AboutMe

This is a repo for my first portfolio website. With this repo, I want to showcase my skills in `Python`, `Django`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`.
The plan is to first create the website. Then host it in a webhosting platform or Linode.

Other improvements:

1. Deploy using docker and Linode. Alternatively use AWS.
